# budgetary-vscode

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- f44b900: Dashboard correctness fixes:

  - The calibration chart escapes the scenario label in point tooltips and looks up scenario colors as own-properties only, so an unusual label can't break the SVG.
  - Pending (not-yet-completed) estimates are shown as rows instead of the dashboard reporting "No estimates yet" on a non-empty ledger.
  - Concurrent and refresh loads are sequenced (newest-wins) and guarded against a disposed panel, so a slow response can't overwrite newer content or throw.
  - The recent-estimates table tolerates an unparseable date without breaking its sort order.

- b4dc94f: Unify API-key resolution behind a single implementation.

  - `@budgetary/sdk` now exports the resolver — `resolveConfigStatus`, `resolveConfig`, the `ConfigStatus` / `ResolvedConfig` types, and the `configFilePath` / `budgetaryDir` path helpers.
  - The mcp server re-exports the shared resolver (its public shape and tests are unchanged) and keeps its own pending-store, language, trace-target, and guidance helpers on top.
  - The VS Code extension drops its private, drifted copy and consumes the shared resolver. **Behavior change:** an _unreadable_ `~/.budgetary/config.json` is now surfaced distinctly ("Config file could not be read") instead of being mislabeled "No API key configured", and the env/file key is trimmed — matching the mcp runtime.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First published release (0.1.0).

  - `@budgetary/sdk` and `@budgetary/mcp` ship to npm with build provenance.
    The SDK publishes a dual ESM + CommonJS build (both `import` and `require`
    resolve the public API); the MCP server ships its `budgetary-mcp` bin.
  - `budgetary-vscode` is published to Open VSX.

  No package behaviour changes — this release wires up distribution only.
