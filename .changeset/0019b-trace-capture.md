Forward a measured execution trace to `/v1/actuals`.

- **SDK:** `ActualsRequest` gains an optional additive `trace` field (`ActualsTraceStep[]` — `{ tool, tokens, kind? }`). It serializes verbatim on the wire; the server classifies it into phases and drops it (without failing the call) if it is over-cap or malformed.
- **MCP:** the Claude Code `on-session-end` auto path now attaches a per-tool trace alongside the realized total, on the **same cache-read-excluded basis**. Token usage in the real Claude Code transcript is reported **per turn** (per `message.id`), not per tool call, so a multi-tool turn's measured tokens are split evenly across its tools (`kind: "turn-split"`). The trace is real, never model-supplied, capped (≤ 512 steps / 16 KB) and fail-closed — over-cap or unreadable ⇒ the total still submits with no trace.
- **MCP (correctness):** the transcript parser now **dedupes turn usage by `message.id`**. Real Claude Code transcripts write one JSONL line per content block, each repeating the turn's `usage`; the previous per-line summation over-counted the realized total ~3–4×. Totals are now counted once per turn (verified against real transcripts), which the trace shares.
